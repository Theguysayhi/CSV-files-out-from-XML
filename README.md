# XML-to-CSV-in-Java
-----------------------

# What does this program do:
This program extracts CSV data from a spesifically formatted XML file, and
then exports it into different CSV files with an appropriate name.
Because this project deals with data manipulation, I've decided to
use Python instead of an object orientated language like Java.

It functions using an importable class called "XmlManager",
which is easily importable for use in other projects. It also includes
extra features such as "tostring()".

# What was not done:
This project has been done to completion

# What could have been done with more time:
If I had more time to dedicate to this project,
I would add more unit tests to better demonstraight any possible limiations of this code.
I added some formatting checks within the code to make it more stable, and this could
have been demonstraighted in the unit tests.

# Instructions on how to run the code and tests:
Simply download the latest release, or download the source code in a zip via github.
A runnable .bat file has been provided for ease of use, which will run the files
it currently has and output them into the root directory of the folder.

Unit tests may be run using the unittest.py file.
